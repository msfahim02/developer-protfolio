                    This guide is all about helping you get familiar with as many areas of web development as possible, as quickly as possible, and then helping you specialize in the one you love. At first, you won’t master anything, you’ll just learn the basics and move to the next thing. Once you find your passion, I’ll show you how to dig deeper.

                    Are you a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a few months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully come to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser. It also involves the painstaking process of writing code that links innumerable pages and styles and most of the times, none of it works together.
